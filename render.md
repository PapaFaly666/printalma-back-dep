Error: 
Generating client into /opt/render/project/src/node_modules/@prisma/client is not allowed.
This package is used by `prisma generate` and overwriting its content is dangerous.
Suggestion:
In /opt/render/project/src/prisma/schema.prisma replace:
4 output        = "../node_modules/@prisma/client"
with
4 output        = "../node_modules/.prisma/client"
You won't need to change your imports.
Imports from `@prisma/client` will be automatically forwarded to `.prisma/client`
